# Reproducibility Demo â€“ CSC 786

This repository demonstrates an ethical, reproducible data-collection workflow used in the CSC 786 course.

## Overview (udpate as necessary)
This project uses open-source NFL datasets (for example, player statistics, play-by-play data, and contextual game data).
This project will collect and preprocess open NFL data, integrate contextual variables (weather, opponent rank, location), 
build a baseline and enhanced prediction models, compare the model accuracy and document all steps for transparency. 
All data collection parameters and metadata are stored in a version-controlled repository.
