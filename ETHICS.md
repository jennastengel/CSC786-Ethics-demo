## Ethical Statement

- Data sources are open and public.
- No personally identifiable information (PII) is collected.
- All API usage complies with provider Terms of Service and rate limits.
- API keys (if required) are stored securely using environment variables.
- Every dataset generated is logged with parameters, timestamps, and hashes in `DATA_README.md`.
- This workflow aligns with academic integrity and reproducibility standards at Dakota State University.

- Potential risks (bias, privacy, security)
  My project will only be using publicly available and anonymized datasets, to ensure the privacy of players.
  My project will ensure representation across all roles to have a balanced dataset of all positions, to ensure model fairness.
  My project will clearly document data sources, steps, and model evaluation, to ensure transparency. 
- Mitigations (data handling, bias checks)
  To mitigate these potential risks I will use only public available and anonymized datasets for data handling. I will have bias
  checks to ensure that their is representation across player positions and teams. 
- Limitations (known constraints)
  Some limitations is that the study relies heavily on publicly available data, which may not include certain contextual variables. 
  Models trained on older data may capture outdated trends in team performance or play-calling strategies.
